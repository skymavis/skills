# Draft — a decision candidate (WIP). Same shape as a decision record, so promotion is
# mechanical; it just carries a 4-letter id and status: draft, and lives in drafts/.
# Filename:  AAAA-kebab-title.md  (AAAA = the 4 UPPERCASE letters of `id` below).
# Promotion, linking, and validation are the decision-records skill's job.
id: ABCD                          # REQUIRED: 4 UPPERCASE letters, a mnemonic of the topic
title: Short imperative title
type: architecture                # a lowercase slug = the directory it lands in on promotion
status: draft                     # draft | under-review
date: YYYY-MM-DD
deciders: [trung]
summary: One sentence describing the decision.
tags: []                          # e.g. [access-control, retrieval, orchestrator]
relates_to: []                    # related record ids — counters and/or draft ids
supersedes:                       # a decision this replaces, or blank
superseded_by:                    # id that replaces this, or blank
