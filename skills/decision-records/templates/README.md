# Decision records

This repo records significant decisions as short, numbered, immutable documents
(ADR-style). Everything lives under `docs/decisions/`, so nothing here is confused
with the repo's other docs.

## Working with an agent (the easy way)

If you use an agent that has the **decision-records** skill installed, just ask — it
knows the lifecycle, mints ids, runs the tool, and keeps the index and links correct.
For example:

- "Capture what we just discussed into a decision draft."
- "Draft an architecture decision: we'll use X for Y."
- "Promote that draft." / "Promote CONF."
- "Supersede our caching decision with a new one that does Z instead."
- "What have we decided about authentication?"
- "Regenerate the decision index."

Promoting and superseding finalize a record, so the agent confirms with you first.

## The lifecycle

A decision moves through three stages, one directory each:

| Stage    | Directory          | Identified by                         | Meaning                                       |
| :------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Draft    | `drafts/`          | a 4-uppercase-letter mnemonic (CONF)  | a work-in-progress candidate; edit freely     |
| Accepted | `accepted/<type>/` | a zero-padded counter (0001, 0002, …) | a finalized, **immutable** decision           |
| Retired  | `archived/`        | (keeps its counter)                   | superseded or deprecated; kept for the record |

There is no "proposed" stage — *proposing* a decision is the act of opening a pull
request that promotes a draft. Once a draft lands in `accepted/`, it is immutable:
you don't edit it, you supersede it with a newer decision. `<type>` is an open
lowercase label you choose (architecture, product, security, policy, legal, …); each
type is its own subdirectory under `accepted/`.

## Reading the records

Start at [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) — a generated table of every accepted and retired
decision with its type, summary, status, and tags. Open the records you need; skip
`archived/` unless you're tracing why a decision changed.

## Authoring & cross-referencing

- Copy `_template.md` for a decision, or `drafts/_template.md` for a draft, and fill
  it in.
- Mint a draft's 4-letter id yourself (a mnemonic of the topic). Accepted records get
  the next global counter automatically when a draft is promoted.
- Refer to another record by writing its id inline — the tooling renders ids as links
  and keeps them correct when files move. Never hand-write a path to a record.

## Promotion & superseding

Promotion turns a draft into the next accepted decision; it is a finalizing step that
needs human sign-off. To replace an existing decision, set the draft's `supersedes`
front-matter to that decision's counter. On promotion (confirmed with
`--allow-replace`) the tool **automatically retires the superseded record for you** —
it moves the old record to `archived/`, flips its status to `superseded`, and records
the new counter in the old record's `superseded_by`. You never hand-edit the record
being replaced.

## The tooling

`scripts/decisions.py` generates the index and cross-links, validates the tree, and
promotes drafts:

```sh
python scripts/decisions.py build [--relink]            # regenerate INDEX.md (+ refresh links)
python scripts/decisions.py check                       # validate (CI-safe; exit 1 if stale)
python scripts/decisions.py promote <name…> [--deref] [--allow-replace]   # draft(s) -> accepted/
python scripts/decisions.py rename-draft-id <name> <NEW>                  # re-id a draft
python scripts/decisions.py install [repo]              # adopt in a repo: symlink + pre-commit
```

Run `python scripts/decisions.py --help` for the rest. This convention is provided by
the **decision-records** skill, which is the source of truth for how the tooling
behaves; this file is a local orientation guide.
